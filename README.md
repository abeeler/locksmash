# Overview
LockSmash is a KeyForge emulator built in an effort to explore how online card games function internally.

# Future Plans
Once the emulator is properly functioning and can handle entire games from start to finish, the next step is to
create a client/server wrapper to allow games to be played via a browser against other people.

Additionally, the emulator provides a framework to try out artificial intelligence development and help explore
what strategies are most effective.
